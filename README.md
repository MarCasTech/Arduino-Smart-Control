# Arduino-Smart-Control
Arduino Smart Control allows you to communicate with your Arduino Nano through the Serial. It is possible to switch from one to 4 LEDs (monostable and bistable mode). The bistable mode has a time set to 1 second by default. In addition to switching the LEDs, you can monitor various sensors such as temperature, humidity, water sensor and brightness sensor. You can save, read and delete the memory with the data acquired or sent to the device.

Anyone is free to give me some suggestions or implement new things!
